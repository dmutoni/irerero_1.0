## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### âœ… Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK: [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Android Studio or VS Code
- An Android/iOS emulator or device

### ðŸ§¶ Run Locally

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmutoni/irerero_1.0.git
cd irerero_1.0

```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
flutter pub get
``` 

3. **Run the app**

```bash
flutter run
```

## ðŸ§  How It Works
- The app displays number learning screens, story pages, and games.

- Content is interactive, with feedback (e.g. shaking widgets or reading aloud).

- Text-to-Speech reads numbers, words, or story text aloud.

- Stories are paginated using PageFlipWidget to simulate book page-turning.
